## Welcome to librehelbreath.

This project is meant to archive all original source codes of classic MMORPG "Helbreath" made by Siementech.

Most of this code is already powering [Helbreath Rocks](http://helbreath.rocks/HelGame/) - first ever web based Helbreath server.

Community is located at [GitHub](https://github.com/librehelbreath/).

### Project goals

- Archive original source code.
- Integrate all **community** owned source code with correct attribution.
- Release a stable distribution of open-source Helbreath server back to the community.
- Learn something and have fun working on open source project.

We're looking for any kind of volunteers: devs, players, testers! Every fan of Helbreath is very welcome to participate in this project.
